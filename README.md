# ZX TCG Deck Converter

This tool fetches public decks from the [ZX TCG official website](https://www.zxtcg.com) and converts them into a card list for importing into a [Tabletop Simulator mod]().

## How to Use

1. Register an account on the [official website](https://www.zxtcg.com), then create a new deck from **"マイデッキ一覧 (My Deck List)"**.
2. Set the deck to **"公開 (Public)"**, and copy the **"公開用URL (Public URL)"**.
3. Download or copy `index.html` and `app.js` into the same directory, then open `index.html` in your browser.
4. Paste the **Public URL** into the input field and click **Import Deck**, then copy the generated deck list.
5. Paste the deck list into the deck importer of the [Tabletop Simulator mod]() to complete the import.
